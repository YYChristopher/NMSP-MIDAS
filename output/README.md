# Output workflow

## Description Folder

The xls file 'RealStateAll.xls' is utilized to plot the upper plot of figure 1. We convert the economic states defined by NBER in the USERC file(data folder) into quarterly form.

The file 'PreProcess' is used to get data to plot.

Running 'CorHeatMap.R' to plot the upper plot of figure 1. The output figures are stored into folder 'Plots'.

Running 'BoxplotD.R' to plot the lower plot of figure 1 and the figure S5 in the online appendix. The output figures are stored into folder 'Plots'.

## Simulation Folder

First, change the work directory into file 'Analysis.R', 'DICPlot.R'(into the folder 'output/Simulation'). 

Then, running 'DICPlot.R' to plot the figure S3 of online appendix. The output figures are stored into folder 'Plots'.

Then, running 'Analysis.R' to plot the figure S4 of online appendix. The output figures are stored into folder 'Plots'.

## RealAnalysis Folder

First, change the work directory into file 'VSPlot.R', 'OOS_NMSP.R' and 'OOS_HMSP.R'(into the folder 'output/RealAnalysis').

Then, running 'VSPlot.R' to plot the figure S6 and S7 of online appendix. The output figures are stored into folder 'Plots'.

Then, running 'OOS_NMSP.R' to plot the (a) subfigure of figure 3 in the Paper which is stored into folder 'Plots'.

Last, running 'OOS_HMSP.R' to plot the (b) subfigure of figure 3 in the Paper which is stored into folder 'Plots'.
